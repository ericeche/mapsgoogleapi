ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* README.md
* cloudtest1.png
* cloudtest2.png
* cloudtest3.png
* cloudtest4.png
* helloworldflowdiagram.png
* javaclasses.png
* listview.png
* maps1.apk
* my-release-key.keystore

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/android-support-v4.jar => app/libs/android-support-v4.jar
* libs/glide-3.5.2.jar => app/libs/glide-3.5.2.jar
* libs/google-api-client-1.10.3-beta.jar => app/libs/google-api-client-1.10.3-beta.jar
* libs/google-api-client-android2-1.10.3-beta.jar => app/libs/google-api-client-android2-1.10.3-beta.jar
* libs/google-http-client-1.10.3-beta.jar => app/libs/google-http-client-1.10.3-beta.jar
* libs/google-http-client-android2-1.10.3-beta.jar => app/libs/google-http-client-android2-1.10.3-beta.jar
* libs/google-oauth-client-1.10.1-beta.jar => app/libs/google-oauth-client-1.10.1-beta.jar
* libs/gson-2.1.jar => app/libs/gson-2.1.jar
* libs/guava-11.0.1.jar => app/libs/guava-11.0.1.jar
* libs/jackson-core-asl-1.9.4.jar => app/libs/jackson-core-asl-1.9.4.jar
* libs/jsr305-1.3.9.jar => app/libs/jsr305-1.3.9.jar
* libs/protobuf-java-2.2.0.jar => app/libs/protobuf-java-2.2.0.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
